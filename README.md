# Psygma
A Discord bot that Cares
--
- Made using discord.py
- Server Members can DM the Bot 
- It generates a random seed based on the User ID of the Member
- From a JSON file of random names, It assigns a name associated with that unique seed
- Bot sends her/his message in the server along with that unique name, maintaining anonymity of the Message
- It's still in work in Progress.
- If you have some suggestion in mind Or would like to contribute to this project, Please feel free to open an issue. :)
